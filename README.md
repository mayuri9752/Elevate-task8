Benefits of Using a VPN:
•	Privacy Protection: A VPN masks our IP address, making it difficult for websites, advertisers, or ISPs to track your online activity.
•	Data Encryption: VPNs encrypt our internet traffic, protecting it from hackers, especially on public Wi-Fi networks.
•	Access to Geo-Restricted Content: we can access websites or streaming content not available in our region.
•	Bypass Censorship: VPNs can help users access restricted content in countries with internet censorship.
Limitations of Using a VPN:
•	Reduced Internet Speed: Encryption and longer routing paths may slow down our connection.
•	Not Fully Anonymous: VPNs don’t make you fully anonymous. The VPN provider can still see your traffic unless they follow a strict no-logs policy.
•	Trust in the Provider: we need to trust that the VPN provider is not logging or misusing your data.
•	Limited Functionality on Free Plans: Many free VPNs have data limits, slower speeds, or fewer server choices.
8.	Conclusion: VPNs are powerful tools for privacy and internet freedom, but we must choose a reputable provider and understand their limitations, especially when using free services.
